## Frontend
This app runs React v18, React Router DOM v6, uses Axios v0.26.1 to communicate with the API, date-fns v2.28.0 to be used by material-ui to render the date picker and material-ui v5.5.3 to component styling. Those are the more important packages and version, you can find dependencie list [here](https://github.com/GastonAQS/ensolvers-challenge/blob/45a2f68a382a17b5c36bf9dc71912908025db336/todo_frontend/package.json)

## Backend
The backend runs on Django v4.0.3 using a SQLite 3 database to persist data and Django REST Framework 3.13.1 to simplify validation process and data presentation.

# Run the app
Go to https://gastonaqs.github.io/ensolvers-challenge/ to see the page, it will require login user: user password: pass, also you can run it locally if GitHub Pages has some problem from dev server. You don't need to run the backend because is running on heroku (url: https://todo-backend-ensolvers.herokuapp.com).
